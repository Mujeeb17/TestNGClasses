Listeners
    - its like an external observer of a test case (it knows if it passed/fails)
    - we can tell listener: if certain test case fails, do the following...

    - in TestNG we have ITestListener interface that has methods:
        - onTestSuccess()
        - onTestFailure()

    - We can make a class that implements ITestListener so we can give those methods
      implementations. @Override those 2 methods
    - We connect the Listener class and Test case using XML by:

      <listener class = (listener class)/>
      <classes>
        <class (test case class)/>
      </classes>

    - note: this only seems to work when you run the XML file, not the actual class with the test case

New Annotations
    - @BeforeClass : runs only one time before the execution of a class
    - @AfterClass : runs only one time after the execution of a class
    - @Before/AfterTest : runs once you start/end a test (refer to xml structure)
        - note you can have multiple <test> inside <suite>
    - @Before/AfterSuite : runs once before/after everything happens

    - these are all more commonly used with frameworks
