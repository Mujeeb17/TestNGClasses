Assertion continued
    - in a single test case, its best to just make one assertion
    - soft assertions should be used in a test case where you have
      more than one assertion and you want to know which assertion is
      failing
    - hard assertions, if you have more than 1 assertion and each assertion
      is only going to pass if the previous one also passed, make all of them
      hard assertions (if you used soft assertions here, you are wasting time
      if one assertion fails)

Data Provider
    - used for data driven testing, same scenario with different sets of data
    - 2D array that holds information you will be using often like a
      username or password in several test cases
    - must have a name
    - use: @DataProvider (name = "")

    - in the @Test annotation you must have:
      @Test (dataProvider = (name of DataProvider))
    - method signature must have the parameters from the data provider
    - the test case will automatically loop through all arrays inside
      the 2D array

    - we should use data provider when we have a few or some test cases
      that use the same type of values, if we had to test several (100+ for ex)
      we should use another type of class (taught later)
